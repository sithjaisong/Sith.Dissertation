% You're not characterizing different environments. They're all tropical, irrigated, lowland rice
%Characterising rice agroecosytems requires knowledge and information of qualitative and quantitative information. One way of gathering data the data necessary for this is through the conduct of surveys. Given the nature of the data, it is not a simple task to analyse and examine in order to derive information and knowledge. One method in particular, network analysis, has been used to explore the observed relationships between the individual elements in a given system. This study is the first known attempt to apply network analysis to the analysis of in-field and household survey data on rice yield limiting and reducing factors. The data will be analyzed and visualized using the proposed network model. I propose to construct a network model using survey data collected from 2009 to 2011 in several sites (Chekempek, West Java, Indonesia; Mekong River Delta, Vietnam; Tamil Nadu, India; and Suphaburi, Thailand) and test the model with data collected from 2012 to 2015 in several cropping seasons and sites (Chekempek, West Java, Indonesia; Red River Delta, Vietnam; Tamil Nadu and Odisha, India; Suphaburi, Thailand). The anticipated results from this research will be helpful for plant health authorities worldwide, in order to design specific strategies for rice pest and disease management and to limit the impacts of these yield reducing factors.
